# Calculator

This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It is my Day 1 project for the Python Confidence Builder collection.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Simple user interface
- Basic error handling (e.g. division by zero)

### TO-DO

In future versions of this program, I plan to add more advanced features such as exponentiation, square roots, and trigonometric functions. I also plan to improve the user interface and add more sophisticated error handling.
